\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}

Modern computer systems are highly-configurable with thousands of interacting configurations with a complex performance behavior. Misconfigurations in these systems can elicit complex interactions between software and hardware configuration options, resulting in non-functional faults. We propose \ourapproach, a novel approach for diagnostics that learns and exploits the system's causal structure consisting of configuration options, system events, and performance metrics. Our evaluation shows that \ourapproach effectively and quickly diagnoses the root cause of non-functional faults and recommends high-quality repairs to mitigate these faults. We also show that the learned causal performance model is transferable across different workload and deployment environments. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of \ourapproach scales to large systems consisting of 500 options and several trillion potential configurations. 

%l\ourapproach's code is released at \url{https://github.com/softsys4ai/unicorn}.

%The experimental results are promising for performance optimization.
